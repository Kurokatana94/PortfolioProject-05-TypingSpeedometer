# Typing Speedometer

- A typing speed testing app that tracks your typing accuracy in real time. Mistakes are highlighted in **purple**, while correctly typed characters appear in **green**â€”giving you immediate visual feedback as you go.
- You'll have **60 seconds** from the moment you type your first letter in the entry field.
- Once the time is up, you'll get a detailed performance summary with your results.
- The text you'll be typing is built from the top 2,000 most used English words, taken from [this repo](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english), and lightly refined to skip any awkward or overly technical terms.
